A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these 
created for the bliss of souls like mine.
and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the 
is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, 
as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God!
